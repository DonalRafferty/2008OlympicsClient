# Olympicsclient

This is a sample project developed using the Angular Cli and WebPack, it showcases Angular 2 components, services, tests and environments.

It is reliant on the 8medalsserver also found in my repos.

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.19-3.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Improvements to be made

Implement error handling, currently the app just bubbles errors and consumes them silently, not good!
Some components have the minimum tests and should be filled out with more robust testing
Add end to end testing
